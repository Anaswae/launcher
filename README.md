# launcher ![GitHub All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/desktopgooseunofficial/launcher/total)

welcome to the launcher for resourcehub!

unfortunately, the launcher is still a very work in progress.

looking for the backend? check [this github repo](https://github.com/desktopgooseunofficial/launcher-backend).

## launch date

when it's ready! end of this week or later, we hope.

### hold on, why is there source code here then?

well, what you see here is a super early access version. it lacks basic features, it doesn't work well.

basically, it's in general not intended for public use just yet, although we want to keep our progress open to everyone!
