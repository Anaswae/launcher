# launcher

welcome to the launcher for resourcehub!

unfortunately, the launcher is still a very work in progress.

looking for the backend? check [this github repo](https://github.com/desktopgooseunofficial/launcher-backend).

## launch date

when it's ready! end of this week or later, we hope.

### hold on, why is there source code here then?

well, what you see here is a super early access version. it lacks basic features, it doesn't work well.

basically, it's in general not intended for public use just yet, although we want to keep our progress open to everyone!


## to-do

allow users to run goose directly from app

updater for launcher, not just mods

add configuration file, and ask for goose file path if config is not found (store this data in config)

add dark mode to menus (enabled in config)
